description: 'Hardware acceleration is the process of delegating a task usually performed by the CPU (Central Processor Unit) to the GPU (Graphical Processor Unit) in order to speed up performance, hence the name hardware acceleration. When applied to CSS, it is useful to know how a browser works in order to understand what is going on and what we can do.'
